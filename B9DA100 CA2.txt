Exercise 2:
Also output the weekly average gross pay for all workers, for each week where there are payslips issued, 
and the total gross pay for each employee for the last six weeks. This may be output to the terminal or to a report
 
Regular hours cannot exceed hours worked or standard hours.
Overtime is time worked exceeding standard hours.
Pay taxed at standardrate cannot exceed gross pay or standard band.
Pay in excess of standardband is subject to the higher rate.
The tax credit reduces the tax payable.
Tax payable cannot be less than zero.

All information to produce the payslips should be pushed to a database of your choice.

You must submit a folder containing:
Your input files used
Payslips produced
Application as a .py file
Screenshot of a select query on the database showing the records stored

You must document your work, either throughout as comments, or as a separate document also included in the folder.

The folder must be .zip compressed
